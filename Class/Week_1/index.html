    <h1>How to Create a Live Website Using Github & Atom </h1>
    <p>
      Start by downloading Atom, a text editor for writing code. Create or log into your account on GitHub. If you've
      just created an account, make sure you verify your e-mail. Github is a website that hosts repositories.
      The software called "Git" is what keeps track of your master file and any changes you have made.
      <ul><strong> Once you're in Github, create a new repository with the following credentials:</strong>
      <li>
      "your username"/ "your username".github.io.
    </li></ul>
      After you've created your repository, download the Github for Desktop application and sign into the
      Github account you just made. This application will allow you to sync your master file in Atom with your
      relative Github repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are signed into the Github for Desktop application, click the plus sign in the top, left-hand corner.
      Click on the "Clone" heading and create a clone of the repository you just made online. Save it somewhere you
      will remember. Your repository should be listed under the Github heading in the sidebar in the Github for Desktop
      app. Right-click and select "open in Atom." Once in Atom, right-click your repository name in the top left-hand
      corner and then select "new file." Create an HTML document and save it. Put some content in it and save it. These
      actions should be updated in your repository in the Github for Desktop App. The changes you made in Atom will be
      highlighted. Put a couple of words in the "Summary" box near the bottom-left of the window and then click "Commit
      to master." This commits to the changes you made in your document. Once you are done commiting, click "sync" in the
      top right-hand corner of the Github for Desktop window to update your live website. It is important to remember to
      click "sync" or else your website will appear unupdated.

        <h2><strong>Things to Avoid:</strong></h2>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Dont touch the git file, it's very easy to make a mistake and ruin the site you're making in here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't edit in the repository, the Github for Desktop application or anywhere that is online. Do all
        your editing in Atom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't sync every time you make changes to your site, maybe once at the end of your work period. This
        may slow down your repository.
      </li>

      <ul>
        <h2><strong>Benefits:</strong></h2>
      </ul>
      <li>
        You now have a live website, that syncs with your master file!
      </li>
